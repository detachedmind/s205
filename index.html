    <h2>My food.....for eating</h2>

    <p><em>my product is the best at being food, because it's edible :O</em></p>

    <p><strong>Look at me</strong>
        You may think you see
        Who I really am
        But you'll never know me
        Every day
        It's as if I play a part
        Now I see
        If I wear a mask
        I can fool the world
        But I cannot fool my heart
        Who is that girl I see
        Staring straight back at me?
        When will my reflection show
        Who I am inside?
        I am now
        In a world where I
        Have to hide my heart
        And what I believe in
        But somehow
        I will show the world
        What's inside my heart
        And be loved for who I am
        Who is that girl I see
        Staring straight back at me?
        Why is my reflection
        Someone I don't know?
        Must I pretend that I'm
        Someone else for all time?
        When will my reflection show
        Who I am inside?
        There's a heart that must be
        Free to fly
        That burns with a need to know
        The reason why
        Why must we all conceal
        What we think, how we feel?
        Must there be a secret me
        I'm forced to hide?
        I won't pretend that I'm
        Someone else for all time
        When will my reflection show
        Who I am inside?
        When will my reflection show
        Who I am inside?
        Inside
        Who I am inside</p>
